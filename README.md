Wildlife Audio Surveillance: Detecting Foreign Entities in Wildlife Environments
🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting foreign entities in wildlife environments using audio classification and processing. By leveraging deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM), our system analyzes recorded audio to identify unnatural sounds such as human presence, vehicles, machinery, and poaching activities. The goal is to assist conservationists and authorities in real-time monitoring of protected areas, ensuring better wildlife protection and ecological balance.

🎯 Objectives
✅ Real-time audio-based monitoring for detecting foreign disturbances
✅ Deep learning-powered classification using CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM
✅ IoT-enabled remote surveillance for large-scale deployment
✅ Accurate identification of multiple foreign entities like human voices, vehicles, chainsaws, and gunshots
✅ Minimizing false positives and negatives for robust threat detection

🛠️ Key Features
🔹 High-Speed Detection: Faster than traditional image-processing-based wildlife monitoring systems
🔹 Multi-Entity Classification: Detects specific threats like human activity, vehicles, and illegal poaching
🔹 Scalable & Durable: Designed for large-scale deployment in diverse environments
🔹 Automated Alerts: Notifies administrators when a foreign entity is detected
